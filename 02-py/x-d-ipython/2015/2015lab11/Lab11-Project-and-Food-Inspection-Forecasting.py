# # CS-109: Fall 2015  -- Lab 11
# 
# ***
# In today's lab we'll talk about:
# 1. Project Guidelines
# 2. Go through an example project with lots of key elements.
# 3. In the middle of (2.) we'll see Elastic Net regularization as an extension of Lasso. What's a lab without learning?!
# 
# This is the main file for the lab, `Lab11-2-Data-Processing.ipynb` is supplemental. 
# ***
# 
# ## But first, this:
# You'll be working in groups now, we encourage you to continue to use `git` but **constant communication** is key. [Slack](https://slack.com/) may be a good option for this!

# # Project Guidelines:
# Much of this is taken directly from the [Project Page](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/projects.html) on the CS109 website.
# 
# > Goal: to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic.
# >
# > How?
# > - acquire the data
# > - design your visualizations
# > - run statistical analysis
# > - communicate the results
# 
# ### Project Milestones:
# - **Proposal**: Due 11/12/2015
# - **Proposal Review**: You'll be assigned a TF as an advisor, they'll review your proposal and meet with your **entire** team.
# 
# 
# ### Data science as a process
# You'll start with an initial idea, your TF should be able to guide you as to the viability of such a proposal. However, as with any project, you'll run into roadblocks! It's important for us to see the entire process and not just the final product. **Your proposal is a great jumping-off point for some of this!**
# 
# >#### IPython Process Book
# 
# >An important part of your project is your iPython process book. Your process book details your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your process book is the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. We strongly advise you to include many visualizations in your process book.Your process book should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:
# 
# > - **Overview and Motivation**: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
# 
# > - **Related Work**: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.
# 
# > - **Initial Questions**: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis? 
# 
# > - **Data**: Source, scraping method, cleanup, storage, etc.
# 
# > - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?
# 
# > - **Final Analysis**: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?
# 
# > - **Presentation**: Present your final results in a compelling and engaging way using text, visualizations, images, and videos on your project web site.
# 
# >Describe the storytelling elements and goals in your process notebook and show us sketches and screenshots of different web site iterations. As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail make sure that your process book is a standalone document that fully describes your process and results.
# 
# ### Final Products
# - **Code**: you've been graded all semester on this, just keep doing a great job at submitting clean code with comments
# - **Website**: make a *public website* (Github pages, Google sites, etc.), summarize the main results of your project and tell a story, **anyone** should be able to read this part of your project, link to your Process Notebook and Github repo. 
# - **Two-minute presentation**: Each team will create a **two minute** screencas (seriously, 2 minutes) with narration showing a demo of your iPython process book and/or some slides.  Upload to YouTube (or Vimeo) and **embed it into your project web page**. Focus on:
#     - main contributions rather than on technical details. 
#     - What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
#     - What insights did you gain? 
#     - What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? 
#     - This should be **one of the first things** someone visiting your website should see.
# 
# ### Peer Assessment
# Remember, data science is an interdisciplinary field, you'll never work alone. It's important that everyone contributes and works well together. So we added this portion to get everyone thinking about teamwork early on.
# 
# > Peer assessment:
# > - **Preparation**: were they prepared during team meetings?
# > - **Contribution**: did they contribute productively to the team discussion and work?
# > - **Respect for othersâ€™ ideas**: did they encourage others to contribute their ideas?
# > - **Flexibility**: were they flexible when disagreements occurred?
# 
# ### Grading Criteria
# 
# > - **Project Scope** - Did you choose the appropriate complexity and level of difficulty of your project?
# > - **Process Book** - Did you follow the data science process and is it well documented in your process book?
# > - **Solution** - Is your analysis effective and correct in answering your intended questions?
# > - **Implementation** - What is the quality of your code? Is it appropriately polished, robust, and reliable?
# > - **Presentation** - Are your web site and screencast clear, engaging, and effective?
# > - **Peer Evaluations** - Your individual project score will also be influenced by your peer evaluations.

# 
# Let's check out the website they built for their project (built with Gihub pages):
# 
# [<img src="./images/chicago_page.png">](http://chicago.github.io/food-inspections-evaluation/)
# 
# We're looking for some of the major elements we discussed above. 
# 
# Some questions about the webpage:
# 
# - Is the writing directed appropriately?
# - Motivation?
# - Do they link to their sources?
# 
# Goal: 
# > To forecast food establishments that are most likely to have critical violations so that they may be inspected first.

# # Download the Data:
# 
# The entire analysis was done in R, I used their code to processed the data to the point where I could use it easily. See `Data-Processing.ipynb`. This is an ipython notebook that uses `R-magic`. If you don't know `R` you can just download the files with processed data into your lab directory.
# 
# **OR, just follow along without running the code**. Running the code isn't as important for this lab.

# ### Goal of the model
# > The principle question is whether we can reasonably determine the probability that a restaurant inspection will yield at least one critical violation.

# Clearly this goal was refined with some experience handling this data, you'll have the same experience as you work with your data.

# ## Elastic Net Regularized Lostic Regression
# 
# #### Recall: Logistic Regression with Lasso
# We've seen Logistic regression with the Lasso penalty, a form of regularization and variable selection. As a reminder, the Logistic regression with Lasso minimizes the equation:
# 
# $$
# \min_{(\beta_0, \beta) \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\left[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N y_i \cdot (\beta_0 + x_i^T \beta) - \log (1+e^{(\beta_0+x_i^T \beta)})\right] + \alpha\ ||\beta||_1
# $$
# 
# We're essentially looking for solutions $(\beta_0, \beta)$ that are **small** in terms of the $L_1$ norm. We've also seen Ridge regression, another type of regularization, essentially the same but with $\lambda\ ||\beta||_2^2$ instead of the $L_1$ norm. 
# 
# 
# ####  Elastic Net Regularized Logistic Regression
# For the final model they decided to use Elastic Net regularization on a logistic regression. This is essentially a combination of Lasso and Ridge regularization, you can see it below in the formulation. 
# 
# >$$
# \begin{aligned}
# \log = \frac{\text{Pr}(V=1|X=x)}{\text{Pr}(V=0|X=x)} = \beta_0 + \beta^T x
# \end{aligned}
# $$
# 
# >Thus, the objective function is to minimize 
# >
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# \min_{(\beta_0, \beta) \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\left[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N y_i \cdot (\beta_0 + x_i^T \beta) - \log (1+e^{(\beta_0+x_i^T \beta)})\right] + \alpha (1-\lambda)||\beta||_2^2/2 + \alpha\lambda||\beta||_1
# \end{aligned}
# $$
# 
# In our code $\lambda =$ `l1_ratio`, and an $\alpha$ range is determined by `eps`, see the [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html) for more details. 
# 
# **Note: They didn't justify their use of this model. We know that prediction is their end-goal. I would like to know what other methods they tried or if they have a specific reason for using this model**

# ## Reading Path Charts
# Both Lasso and Elastic Net regularization have the property that with enough regularization (large $\alpha$) (or small $-log(\alpha)$ on the chart) the coefficients ($\hat\beta_0, \hat\beta_1, ..., \hat\beta_p$) get shrunk to 0. That means they're no longer playing a role in the prediction! Recall:
# 
# $$\hat y_i = \frac{exp(\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 X_{i1} + ... + \hat\beta_p X_{ip})}{1 + exp(\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 X_{i1} + ... + \hat\beta_p X_{ip})}$$
# 
# First let's notice that the `Inspector*` variables are all present, except for one -- `InspectorYellow` is missing, but it's easy to see that it wouldn't be informative at all. Simply knowing that the region wasn't any of (`blue`, `brown`, ..., `purple`) will tell you that the inspection was in `yellow`. So the regularization does a good job at getting rid of this redundant information. 
# 
# What this means for us is that we can look at a chart like the one above and see that (from left to right) the first variable to enter the model is `InspectorBlue`, `InspectorPurple`, etc. 
# 
# Other main findings they gathered from this chart:
# 
# > - Establishments that had previous critical or serious violations
# > - Whether the establishment has a tobacco license or has an incidental alcohol consumption license
# 

# # Model Validation/testing
# The super impressive thing about this analysis (to me) is their way of testing their results. 
# 
# The discovery of a critical violation is a time-sensitive issue! The earlier an inspector can find these critical violations the better. So instead of just looking at things like accuracy, f1 score, etc. they looked for a way of vallidating the model within the contect of the problem. Here's how:
# 
# - They used the data before **July 31, 2014** to fit the model. 
# - They selected a model parameters using **August 1-31, 2014** as a tuning dataset.
# - They used the model to predict critical violations in the 1,637 food establishments that were scheduled for **September 1, 2014 to October 31, 2014**. 
# - Based on the predictions they could create a schedule of inspections that would hopefully yield a higher number of critical violations earlier.
# - They then let the inspectors go on about their business, reposting critical violations as they do.
# - At the end of the month, they compared what happened to what `could have happened` if they used the schedule based on predictions.
# 
# > After formulating the analytical model, the the principal question for researchers turned to whether this analytical model provides more efficiency for the food inspection team. CDPH operational procedures requires the department to inspect every risk 1 and risk 2 restaurant. Therefore, the operational goal is to allow inspectors to discover critical violations earlier than their current operations (business-as-usual).

# # Some further notes:
# 
# - Further inspection of their code revealed a very detailed analysis, the selected their tuning parameters using a validation set. 
# - Due to the ongoing nature of the problem, it makes sense to validate on only the latest data.
# - Further exploration in terms of models could show some improvement.
# - The writeup contained lots more analysis and information than the website for those who are interested.
